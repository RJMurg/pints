# Pints

I owe a lot of people pints.
This site helps me keep track of that.

## Setup:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RJMurg/SvelteKit-Prisma-Template.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You are now ready to develop!
